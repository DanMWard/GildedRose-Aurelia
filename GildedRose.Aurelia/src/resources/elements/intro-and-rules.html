     As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-start align-items-center">
      <i class="fas fa-beer mr-3"></i> 
      <span class="text-left">All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</span>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-start align-items-center">
      <i class="fas fa-beer mr-3"></i>
      <span class="text-left">All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is</span>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-start align-items-center">
      <i class="fas fa-beer mr-3"></i>
      <span class="text-left">At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
