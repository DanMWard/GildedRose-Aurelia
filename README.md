# GildedRose-Aurelia
GildedRose Kata with aurelia front end, typescript and BDD with Jest

Purpose of this kata is to learn how to:

- Cover existing code with tests using the jest test framework
- Refactor the aurelia code into reusable components
- How to implement application state pattern using aurelia-store and RxJS (also covered by tests)

## Getting started

run:

 `yarn install`

This will install all the required dependencies.

To run the site simply run:

`au run`

The port the site binds to is 3000, so you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

All instructions on the kata are on the home page, and there are further help pages if you get stuck.

To run the tests run:

`au jest`

This will run the tests and provide a code coverage report. If you are coding in VSCode there is a debugging configuration set up to debug the tests. It will hit debugger statements and breakpoints. Whilst its not perfect, this is incredibly useful to step through failing tests.
